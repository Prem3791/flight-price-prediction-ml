# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project builds a supervised machine learning model to predict flight ticket prices using features such as airline, source, destination, duration, and total stops. The model is built using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and includes GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
